## Default export using Component Story Format 3(CSF3)

We define stories according to the <a href='https://storybook.js.org/blog/component-story-format-3-0/'>Component Story Format</a> (CSF), an ES6 module-based standard that is easy to write and portable between tools.

The key ingredients are the default export that describes the component, and named exports that describe the stories.
